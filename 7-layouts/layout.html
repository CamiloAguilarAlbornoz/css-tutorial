                        <strong>Batman 60s</strong><br><br>
                        Adam West was the first to play Batman in a fun series that started
                        in 1966 and I conclude in 1968, it had quite a colorful tone, very different
                        to which the character would have in later years

                        <strong>Batman, Batman Returns</strong><br><br>
                        Trying to get away from the colorful tone of the 60s series, Tim Burton
                        made 2 films about the character during the years 1989 and 1992, being
                        these "Batman" and "Batman Returns", which were quite successful.

                        <strong>Batman Forever</strong><br><br>
                        Warner, wanting to make the Batman movies more familiar, they replaced
                        Tim Burton with Joel Schumacher, who gave the franchise a very similar tone
                        to that of the 60s, beginning the decline of the saga.

                        Out of respect for the actors and actresses who were not to blame and only followed
                        a horrible script, no image was placed in which these appear, spare
                        To say that this is one of the worst movies ever created.

                        After the failure of Batman and Robin, Chistopher Nolan set out to create a
                        new trilogy about the character, resulting in one of the most successful,
                        my favorite "The Dark Knight".

                        In an attempt to copy Marvel's success with his cinematic universe,
                        Warner tried to create his with DC choosing a new Batman, be it good or
                        not on paper, bad decisions have not allowed this idea to take off.
